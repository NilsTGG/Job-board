            <p>
              Look, I get it. You've been meaning to move those shulker boxes
              from your main base to your secondary outpost for weeks. You keep
              telling yourself "I'll do it tomorrow" while they sit there,
              taking up chest space and judging you silently. Well, now I'm
              judging you too, but at least I'm getting paid for it.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's where I come in. I'm a professional Minecraft courier who
              specializes in doing the tedious transport jobs that you've been
              procrastinating on. Judgment included free of charge, along with
              efficient service and a healthy dose of attitude.

                Payment is due upon completion. No "I'll pay you next week"
                nonsense.
              </li>

                I'm not responsible for items lost to your own stupidity
                (leaving chests unlocked, building in lava, forgetting to light
                up your base, etc.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Rush jobs cost extra. Your poor planning is not my emergency...

                I reserve the right to refuse service to anyone who asks me to
                "just quickly" do something that's clearly not delivery.
              </li>
              <li>
                All deliveries are final. No returns, no exchanges, no "can you
                move it again?"
              </li>
              <li>
                I'm professional, but I'm also slightly unhinged. Expect quality
                service with a side of attitude.
